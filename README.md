# WorkSync AI

**An AI-powered background agent that automatically prioritizes your work based on real context from Azure DevOps, Teams chats, and email communications.**

> ðŸŽ¯ **Vision**: Transform scattered enterprise task chaos into intelligent, automated workflow decisions that save hours daily.

## The Problem

Your Azure DevOps tasks all look equal priority, but the real urgency is scattered across Teams chats, emails, and calendar discussions. **Bug #1234** looks normal in ADO, but there are 3 escalations in Teams, 2 urgent emails, and a client call scheduled. You should work on it first, but how would you know?

## Our Solution

WorkSync AI runs as a background agent that:
1. **ðŸ§  Analyzes** all your communication channels for task-related context
2. **ðŸ“‹ Prioritizes** your ADO backlog based on real urgency signals  
3. **ðŸŽ¯ Provides** step-by-step execution guidance for each task
4. **ðŸ“Š Learns** from your choices to improve recommendations

## Current Status

- **âœ… Phase 1 Complete**: Secure ADO integration foundation ready
- **ðŸš§ Phase 2 In Progress**: AI Priority Engine + Microsoft Graph integration
- **ðŸŽ¯ Phase 3 Planned**: Advanced learning and team intelligence

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fantops/WorkSyncAI.git
cd WorkSyncAI/backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Add your ADO_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN
npm start
npm test
```

## Why This Matters

**Every enterprise has this exact problem**: Scattered task context across communication channels with no intelligent coordination. WorkSync AI is the missing intelligence layer that makes Microsoft's entire productivity ecosystem actually productive.

**From**: Hours of manual prioritization daily  
**To**: Seconds of AI-powered workflow decisions
